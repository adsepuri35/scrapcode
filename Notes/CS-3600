Lecture 1:
AI - science of making machines that think like people, think rationally, act like people, act rationally.

Rational - maximally achieving pre-defined goals
Brief history of AI:
40s-50s - boolean circuit model of brain, Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"
50s-70s - early AI programs
70s-90s - statistical methods for speech recognition, systems industry booms
90s - statistical approaches, Deep Blue chess bot.
2000-2014 - Modern AI foundations, neural networks, AlphaGo, IBM Watson
2014-now - Deep Learning Revolution, imagenet accuracy

LLMs - transformer neural architecture, good at learning to emulate language, GPT-3 = 175 billion parameters. GPT-4 = 1.8 Trillion parameters


Lecture 2:
Agent - entity that perceives and acts.
Utility - numerical value assigned to a potential outcome or action. Represents how desirable an outcome is to an AI system.
Rational agent - selects actions to maximize expected utility

Agents perceives environment through sensors. The action space is determined and then actuators perform actions on the environment to influence it.
