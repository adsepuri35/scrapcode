Lecture 3: Reaching Definitions, Data Flow Analysis

gen - set of definitions that are generated by a statement
kill - set of all definitions that are overwritten by S
in - set of definitions that are alive right before S
out - (in[s] \ kill[s]) U gen[s]

Fixed point iteration algorithm - 
Input: flow graph for which kill[B] and gen[B] are computed for each basic block B
Output: in[B] and out[B] for each block B
Algo: use iterative approach where initial "in" and "out" info is propogated across edges and along the paths of the graph until none of the outs change.

B1 = 0000000, 1110000
B2 = 1111110, 0011110

Lecture 4:
value number V(i) - assigned to each expression. Can be used to compare expressions, and can be replaced with references.

local value numbering - limited to a single basic block. get <operator, o_1, o_2>, hash value to get a value number.

If o_1 and o_2 are constant, evaluate, assign to T_i, mark T_i as a constant.

Optimization scopes:
Local - single block. strong optimizations based on block properties.
Regional - multiple blocks in CFG. Loops, trees, paths.
Whole Procedure - entire CFG. Cyclic paths = analysis -> transformation
Whole program - mulitple procedures. must contend with call/return & param binding.

Extended Basic Block (EBB) - maximal set of blocks where each B_i except B_1 has 1 predecessor.

Dominator - x dominates y if for every acyclic path to y, x is included.

Lecture 5:
Redundant Expression - expression redundant at point p, on every path to p
1. It is evaluated before reaching p
2. None of its constituent values is redefined before p

Partially redundant - redundant along some, but not all paths reaching p

Loop invariant expression - partially redundant. partial redundancy elimination performs code motion.
