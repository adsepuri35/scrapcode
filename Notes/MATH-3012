Set relations
Cartesian Products
Relation functions
Domain, codomain, range of function f

Set operations:
Look at complements, set syntax, disjoint subsets, Universe u, | Size |

Lecture 1:
B ⊆ A = B is a subset of a
B ⊂ A = B is not a proper subset of A, meaning B does not equal A

Relations:
Relation R is relfexive on set S, if for all x in S, (x,x) in R
Relation R is irrelfexive on set S, if for all x in S, (x,x) not in R
Relation R is symmetric on set S if for all x in S and y in S, if (x,y) in R, then (y,x) in R

Function X to Y if each element of
