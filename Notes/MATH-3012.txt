Part 1:

B ⊆ A : B is a subset of A. Meaning B can equal A.
B ⊂ A : B is a proper subset of A. B does not equal a
A ⊇ B : B is a subset of A, or A contains B as a subset

Relation on sets X and Y is a set of ordered pairs (x,y) where x in X and y in Y.

Reflexive relation: for all x in S, (x,x) in R
Irreflexive relation: for all x in S, (x,x) not in R
Symmetric relation: for all x in S and for all y in S, if (x,y) in R then (y,x) in R
Antisymmetric: Opposite of above
Transitive relation: for all x,y,z in S, if (x,y) in R, and (y,z) in R, then (x,z) in R

Cartesian product of X times Y is the relation consisting of all ordered pairs (x,y).

A relation f from X to Y is a function if each element of X appears in exactly one ordered pair of f. 
- domain of f is X,
- codomain of f is Y,
- range of f is the subset of Y containing the elements of Y that appear in ordered pairs of f,

A function X to Y is injective (1-to-1) is each element of the range appears in exactly one ordered pair

A function is surjective (onto) if the codomain and range are equal

f is bijective if it's one-to-one and onto

Pigeonhole Principle - If you must put n + 1 pigeons into n holes, then you must put 2 pigeons in the same hole.

If you must put kn + 1 pigeons into n holes, then you must put k + 1 pigeons into the same hole.

Remember number of arrangements of letters.

The number of circular permutations of n distinct objects is (n-1)!

Combinatorial proof - counts the same set of objects in 2 different ways, proving the numbers obtained are equal.

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

Remember - Binomial theorem
Remember - Stars and Bars

Ex:
Total sum = stars = 5
Use 2 bars to partition stars into three groups
Total symbols = 7 symbols
Choose 2 positions for the bars out of 7 total positions

Formal definition:
(n + k - 1) choose n = (n + k - 1) choose (k - 1)
