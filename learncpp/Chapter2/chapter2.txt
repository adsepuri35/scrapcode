Chapter 2:

2.1 
Nested functions are illegal.

2.2
The main() function is required to return an int. 
Explicit function calls to main() are not allowed.

The return value from main is also called a status code to signal that the program was successfully run. (Convention to return 0). 

The main() function will implicitly return 0 if not specified, but best practice to do anyways.

C++ standard has 3 status codes:
- 0 - program executed successfully
- EXIT_SUCCESS - program executed successfully
- EXIT_FAILURE - program did not execute successfully
These status codes are preprocessor macros defined in the <cstdlib> header.

2.3 
Return a value from a void function results in compile error
