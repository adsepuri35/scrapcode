    "# Part 1 - Text Adventure Games\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "*Text Adventure Games* are games in which the player interacts with a rich world only through text. Text adventure games predate computers with graphics. However, in many ways they are more complex than conventional video games because they can involve complicated interactions (e.g., \"build a rope bridge\") that require a fair amount of imagination. Indeed, text adventure games are used as [research testbeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05398) for natural language processing agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical text adventure game is [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), in which the player discover an abandoned underworld realm full of treasure. You can find online playable versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A text game is made up of individual locations--also called \"rooms\", though they need not be indoor enclosed spaces as the term might imply. The agent can move between rooms and interact with objects by typing in short commands like \"move north\" and \"take lamp\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will use a special package that implements text worlds for testing agents: [TextWorld-Express](https://github.com/cognitiveailab/TextWorldExpress). Textworld-Express simplifies text worlds in a few ways: it uses a reduced set of text commands, and rooms laid out in a grid.\n",
    "TextWorld-Express also implements a few different game objectives, such as cooking, and searching for coins.\n",
    "TextWorld-Express generates world configurations, so we will need to implement algorithms that are able to complete different game objectives in different world configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, our agents will play two different games:\n",
    "- **Coin Game**: a game in which the agent must search for and pick up a single coin.\n",
    "- **Map Reader**: a game in which the agent must find a coin and return it to a box at the starting location.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be implementing various search algorithms towards these games to help the agent succeed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes and Guidelines\n",
    "- You are **only** allowed to use a restricted set of libraries for this assignment. All packages that come with the default Python installation are permitted, as well as any imports we have already provided for you. You may not use any other libraries than the ones we have provided. If you attempt to use other libraries, the autograder will not be able to run your code.\n",
    "- In the Map Reader game, you must use a single search loop (you cannot run a search to the coin and then a separate search to the box). You cannot write specialized code for handling the Map Reader game. You cannot memorize the path to the coin and then reverse it.\n",
    "- Do not change the data within the global variables containing environment data that are loaded from file.\n",
    "- TextWorldExpress requires Java 1.8 or higher to be installed on your system. For more information, see the [TextWorld-Express README](https://github.com/cognitiveailab/TextWorldExpress).\n",
    "- Do not modify any function signatures or the global variables provided in the notebook. You may add additional helper functions as needed - do not add them to separate cells, as they will not be exported in the autograder. **Any helper functions should be nested within the function that uses them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helpful Tips\n",
    "- If you break execution of a cell running the game engine, you may put TextWorld-Express in an un-recoverable state. If this happens, you will need to reset your kernel/runtime.\n",
    "- In the Map Reader game, you cannot use the map information (it isn't helpful anyway).\n",
    "- You cannot (and shouldn't) filter any actions. We've already filtered out the actions that we don't want your agent to have to consider. For example, the \"take map\" action is never helpful, but you must explore it. Your implementations should quickly realize that that action creates a state self-loop and disregard it.\n",
    "- Think about when you mark a state as visited. You should mark a state as visited when you have visited it, not when you are about to visit it. This will help you avoid infinite loops and cycles - this is a core concept in uninformed and informed search algorithms. "

    "Heuristics are functions that estimate the cost or distance from a given state to the goal state in search algorithms. They play a crucial role in informed search strategies, such as A* and greedy best-first search, by guiding the search process towards the most promising paths. The importance of heuristics lies in their ability to reduce the search space and improve efficiency. By providing an estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal, heuristics help prioritize which nodes to explore first, potentially leading to faster solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A well-designed heuristic can significantly enhance the performance of an algorithm, making it more effective in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions. Conversely, a poor heuristic may lead to increased computation time and suboptimal paths. In the context of the Coin and Map Reader games, implementing effective heuristic functions can help the search algorithm navigate the environment more intelligently, ultimately resulting in quicker and more efficient gameplay."

    "- `graph`: a list of state transitions (i.e., `GRAPH`)\n",

    "- For your implementation, you should **not** terminate if you find the goal state in the successor function when expanding the search. You should only terminate when you visit the goal state in the search algorithm. While many search algorithms can terminate upon finding a goal state when expanding successors, we are requiring that you expand all nodes in the search to ensure that all solutions return the same path when expanding successors. As such, you should only terminate when you visit the goal state in the search algorithm. "
