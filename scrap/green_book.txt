River crossing -
Intuition: We want to pair C, D and together, because they take the longest to cross and D paired with anyone will take 10 minutes, so might as well pair him with C who takes the second longest to cross.
1,2 - 2
1 - 3
5, 10 - 13
2 - 15
1, 2 - 17

Birthday problem - Revisit
Days = {1,2,4,5,7,8}
Months = {Mar, Jun, Sept, Dec}
If unique day, C knows the date immediately. So it can't be June 7 or December 2nd. Because you know that C doesn't know the birthday initially, you can eliminate June and December.

Card game -
Intuition: Seems like it will always end in a tie. Because of the symmetric nature of having 52 cards (even). If there were an odd number of cards thats a different story and it would depend on if the card was black or red. I would pay 0.

Burning ropes - 
Intuition: Burn one rope both ends until its gone is 30 min. If we do that for one rope and for the other rope, we burn one side, we have a 30 min rope remaining. We can burn both ends of that in 15 min. Giving us 45 min measured.

Hourglasses -
Begin both at the same time. When 4 min hourglass ends, we have 3 minutes left on the 7 min hourglass. If we start a 4 minute hourglass immediately after that, we have 1 minute left on the 4 min hourglass when the 7 min hourglass runs out (start measuring here). We have 1 min so far, if we flip the 4 min one 2 times in a row, we have 8 minutes. 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Defective ball -
If you know whether the defective ball is heavier or lighter, you can identify the defective ball among up to 3^n balls using no more than n measurements.

Trailing Zeros - 
Each pair of 2 and 5 add a trailing zeros. So does each multiple of 10.
floor(100 / 2) = 50
floor(100 / 5) = 20
We can inspect the 20 numbers further. 4 are divisible by 5^2, so the total frequency of 5 is 24 and there are 24 trailing zeros.
My way:
9 zeroes added by (10, 20, 30, ..., 90).
2 added by 100
13 added by multiples of 5 (not multiples of 10) paired with 2 (5, 15, 25). Double count for multiples of 5^2 (25, 50, 75)

Horse race - 
We need to see every horse race.
Attempt:
Number 1-25. Top 3 for 5 races still possible. 15 horses left.
If we take the winners of each race (5) and race them. We know that for sure, that winner is the fastest. We take the 2nd and 3rd horses from the winners previous race, the 2nd place horse from current 2nd place horses previous race and the third place horse and race them (5). Then we can determine the 2nd and 3rd fastest horses.

Infinite sequence -
We know that x^x^x^x... = 2. So if we extract one x term, we have x^(x^x^x^x...) = x^2 = 2. So x = sqrt(2).

2.3
Box packing - 
Brick volume = 4, box volume = 216, 53 * 4 = 212
Imagine the 6x6x6 cube is divided into 2x2x2 cubes. Like a chessboard, the colors alternate. 216 / 8 = 27. So there are 27 cubes. 14 white cubes and 13 black cubes. each cube can be used by max 4 bricks. 13 * 4 = 52. So we can't place 53 bricks.

Calendar cubes -
0 - only one cube, since you can't have 00.
1, 2 on both cubes. (11, 22)
6 doubles as a 9 -> keep on one die
Die 1 - 0,1,2,3,4,5
Die 2 - 0,1,2,6,7,8

Door to offer - 
2 scenarios:
1. Truther guards offer. Liar guards exit
2. Truther guards exit. Liar guards offer
If we ask straightforward question (u guarding the door?) In scenario 1, both answer yes. In scenario 2, both say no. So that wouldn't work.
Involve both guards.
Question - "Would the other guard say that you are guarding the door to the offer?"
In scenario 1, if we ask truther, he would say no (liar would say the truther is not guarding the door). If we ask the liar, he would say yes (the truther would say the liar is not guarding the door (no)). In scenario 2, if we ask the truther, he would say yes (liar would say truther is guarding the door to the offer). If we ask the liar, he would say no (truther would say the liar is guarding the door to the offer).
So if the guard says yes, we choose the other door. If the guard says no, we choose that door.

Message delivery - 
You and your colleague each have a unique key. Place 2 locks on the box, one that can be opened by your key and the other can be opened by your colleague.
If you want to send documents to your colleague. Place the documents in the box, lock your lock. Colleague receives it, locks his lock, sends to you. You unlock your lock, and send it to colleague. Colleague unlocks his lock and accesses the documents. The box always stays locked in transit.

Crossing the stream - 
Traveler has:
cat, mouse, cheese
raft can fit him, one other item
cat left w/ mouse, it will eat it
mouse left w/ cheese, it will eat it
Attempt 1:
Only option is to cross w/ mouse. mouse is on other side.
Goes back by himself
Takes the cheese to other side. takes mouse back with him.
Drops off mouse on og side, takes cat with him. drops off cat.
Goes to og side by himself.
Picks up mouse and goes to other side.
All items are on the other side.

Last ball - 
Consider every outcome:
Both blue = (B,R) -> (B - 1, R)
Both red = (B,R) -> (B + 1, R - 2)
Blue and red = (B,R) -> (B - 1, R)
Red only stays the same or decreases by 2. We know that the number of balls decrease by 1 in every iteration. Since the number of blue balls can be odd but the number of red can't, the last ball must be blue since we start with 14 red (even). If the number of red balls was odd initially. The last ball would be red.

Light switches - 
Remember that after we turn the light on and off, the lightbulb will be hot. With 3 switches, it's simple. With 4 switches, we introduce a binary factor. (on/off, hot or cold.) However, we can still do it in one go.
Turn on switch 1 and 2, wait for a bit. Turn off switch 2 and turn on switch 3. If hot and on -> 1. hot and off -> 2. cold and on -> 3. cold and off -> 4.

Quant salary - 
Multiple solutions. Intuition - the average can be calculated as the sum of all salaries divided by the number of quants (8). So the first quant can pick a random number add his salary to it. The 2nd quant will add their salary and so on until all quants have added their salary to the sum. The first quant will then subtract the random number and divide by 8 to get the average salary.

Matching Socks -
Choose 3 socks. They can be red, yellow, and blue. The next sock chosen will have to be one of those colors. Hence, you need to choose 4 socks.

Handshakes - 
Attempt: 26 total people. 25 people shook hands with >= 1 person. You shook hands with 25. Each person can shake between 1-24 people = 24 people. Since there are 25 people, someone had to have shaken the same number of hands as someone else.

Have we met before? -
Use mutual exclusion. Either you know >= 3 of the people or you don't know >= 3 people. In either case, if we consider each case, if those 3 people you know didnt meet each other, the statement holds and if the 3 people you don't know all know each other, the statement holds.

Ants on a square - 
Area of square = 1. Area of circle ~ 0.06. Divide the sqaure into 25 smaller areas. At least one of the areas must have 3 ants. It will fit one area.
